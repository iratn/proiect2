        <h2> About </h2>


        <p> Community of software developers getting together to help one another out. The software industry relies on
            collaboration and networked learning. We provide a place for that to happen.
            We believe in transparency and adding value to the ecosystem. We hope you enjoy poking around and
            participating!
            Our team is distributed around the world. We have no office, but we come together online each day to build
            community and improve the software careers of millions.

            Happy coding!
